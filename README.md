Notepod is a note-sharing app which we have built from scratch using Python, Java, and CSS in the platform of Visual Studio Code. The purpose of this app is to allow users from different communities to share community-specific notes (for example: a specific class at a specific notes) and access these notes using a variety of filters. The features of this app is firstly, users can join a pod, which is basically a community. Based on this pod, they can upload and access pod-specific notes using a filter option. Next, users can upload notes, and then users can filter notes they want to view based on keywords, pod-only, and subject and sub-subject. Overall, NotePod is a networking app that aims to allow students who are struggling in specific classes and unable to access resources to find the resources that they need directly from their peers.
